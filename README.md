Currently this repo contains 880k files and 294k directories (Warning: potential performance hazard if you clone this repo on Windows).
Best practice would be to use a (virtual) ReiserFS (which excels at handling extremely large number of small files) partition, although anywhere on a usual Linux machine should still suffice.
