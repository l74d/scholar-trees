# scholar-trees

## Treebank generated from abstracts of arXiv articles as indexed by DBLP.

Here is a batch of parse trees generated by two constituency parsers, one from [StanfordNLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml) and the other being the state-of-the-art in constituency parsing, [Neural Adobe-UCSD Parser](https://github.com/KhalilMrini/LAL-Parser).

Compared to Penn Treebank, this dataset is free to use while being substantially larger with 1.6M sentences rather than ~50k in Penn Treebank or variants.
This dataset would not be a good choice if you are looking to train the next best parser, as it has NOT been manually edited.
However for tasks taking parse trees as input, like information extraction, you now have much more stuff to play with right away, without doing your own data wrangling.

The dataset is offered as plain files under plain directories for ease of random access, where `by-constituency-parser/` plus the DBLP id (e.g. `journals/corr/AlakuijalaOSW17`) is the path under which the files `LAL` and `Stanford` are the parse trees generated by the respective parsers. Each line of file is from a parsed sentence. Additionally, `constituency-agreed/` holds sentences for which both parsers generate exactly the same parse.

Currently this repo contains 880k files and 294k directories (Warning: potential performance hazard if you clone this repo on Windows).
Best practice would be to use a (virtual) ReiserFS partition which excels at handling a large number of small files, although anywhere on a usual Linux machine should suffice.
